### Overview of project

## OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT
Provide a simple and user-friendly command-line interface for performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

Allow users to input two numbers and select an operation to compute the result.

Ensure proper handling of errors, such as division by zero, and guide users with clear prompts and messages.

Serve as an educational example of how to implement fundamental programming concepts such as user input, control structures, and error handling in Java.







## Key feature of project
User Input: Prompts the user to input two numbers for calculation.

Operation Selection: Allows the user to choose an arithmetic operation from addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

Switch Case Logic: Uses a switch statement to handle different operations based on the userâ€™s selection.

Division by Zero Handling: Includes error handling for division by zero, displaying an error message if attempted.

Result Display: Outputs the result of the selected operation in a clear, user-friendly manner.

Validation of Operation: Ensures the user chooses a valid operation, showing an error message for invalid inputs.

Modular Design: Clean structure with easily extendable logic for additional operations or features in the future.
